# What does it do?

This takes all the files in an input folder and sorts them into folders in the designated output folder. The script uses regular expressions to determine how the sorting is handled.

# How to Run

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your system.

Before you use the script, open it up with notepad or any text editor you want first. Place your input directory in the input_dir = "<Input Directory here>" line and your output directory in the output_dir = "<Output Directory Here>" line.

If you know how regular expressions work, you can add your own folder name and regex pairs yourself.

Then you can either run the script on python or just double click the script in your directory.
